Observations;
	Starts from main.scr and works from there.
	Empty lines are discarded.	
	background, foreground, sound and script dirs can be substituted with a .zip of the same name. 
	The format is designed for a 256x192px screen, high res targets scale up from that.
		setimg coordinates are scaled by (ScreenWidth/256) and (ScreenHeight/192) before drawing. (2.5x on a 640x480 novel)
	I'm unsure how route completion variables are stored. 

Flow:
	label Namenamename
		Used for goto's
	goto LabelName
		Goes to named label in current script
	jump Script.scr
		Dumps current script and starts named file. Always loaded from Scripts/

	choice Text 1|Text 2|Text 3
		Dumps choice number to "selected" variable. First choice is (selected == 1)
		Not sure how many choices are possible, at least 10.
		[exit] as a choice seems to abort something. Test it.

Variables:
	setvar name = value
		Sets variable to value. Seems to support Int's or String's
	if name == value
		Skip to next/paired "fi" label when false
		Unsure if if's can be nested. Test.
	fi
		Ends if block
	setvar ~ ~
		Clears every variable? Only seems to be used at the top of main.src

Audio:	(.ogg/.mp3/.aac)
	music path.format
		^Loads from Sounds/ and loops until changed
	music ~
		clears music.
	sound path.format
		^Loads from Sounds/ and plays once
	sound ~
		clears sound.

Graphics:	(.jpg / .png)
	bgload path.format
		^Always loads from background dir
		Input blocking.
	bgload ~
		Clears background
	setimg path x y
		^Loads image from foreground dir and sets to x&y (From top-left corner)
		Investigate : How are multiple foreground images handled? 

Text:
	text words words words
		^Everything on line after "text" is parsed
	text ~
		Brief pause (1/2th second? test).	Tsukihime is littered with these during dramatic moments.
	text @words
		Unsure.
	text !
		Unsure.

Note on x & y handling
